# USWeatherMap
CGI python script that displays US map with  states colored based on the temperature range.

This is one of the mini projects from CU's Methods and Tools class taught by Elizabeth Boese, that I though was pretty cool and handy.
I am not a fan of running python to generate html, as I am a huge javascript bigot. Even though the preprocessing and calculation happens on the server side, there are more elegant templating engines and solutions out there (like jade or handlebars or even Angular).
Nonetheless, this was a great opprotunity for me to realize that I will never again touch python to generate my html content. :)
